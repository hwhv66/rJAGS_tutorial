# rJAGS Tutorial

A tutorial for using JAGS inspired by the *Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Models* course offered by UC Santa Cruz on Coursera.org.

This tutorial includes topics like:
  1) Bayesian Linear Regression
  2) Bayesian ANOVA models
  3) Bayesian Logistic Regression
  4) Bayesian Poisson Regression
  5) Bayesian LASSO (BLASSO)
  6) Posterior Inference
  7) Model Diagnostics

In addition, there is a short (currently incomplete) tutorial on rSTAN.

Pull requests are welcome and appreciated.
